Welcome to **PDF Toolkit** – a clean and simple desktop app built to help you **merge**, **rename**, and **split** PDF files effortlessly. Whether you're handling academic papers, work documents, or just organizing your digital clutter, this tool gets the job done quickly and easily.

---

## 📦 Latest Version

**Version:** [v1.2.0](https://github.com/JourneyCodesAyush/PDF-Toolkit/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

**Release Date:** October 24, 2025

**Status:** Stable

**Download:** [PDF-Toolkit.v1.2.0.zip](https://github.com/JourneyCodesAyush/PDF-Toolkit/releases/download/v1.2.0/PDF-Toolkit.v1.2.0.zip)

### ✨ What's New in v1.3.0:

- 🖥️ CLI refactor: moved entry point to `cli/__main__.py` for standard Python packaging.
- 🔀 CLI now uses subcommands (`merge`, `split`, `rename`, `batch_merge`, `batch_rename`, `batch_split`) instead of flags.
- 🛡️ Improved handling for encrypted PDFs: CLI can now process encrypted PDFs with password prompts (`--skip-all` option remains available).
- 📝 Updated CLI usage examples in documentation to reflect subcommand syntax.

### ✨ What's New in v1.2.0:

- 🛡️ Added GUI prompt for encrypted PDFs: operations now ask for password instead of stopping abruptly.
- 🔗 Updated core modules to support password callbacks for encrypted PDFs.
- ⚡ Minor improvements and bug fixes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 **Merge PDFs** – Combine multiple PDF files into one.
- ✏️ **Rename PDFs** – Give your PDF files cleaner, more meaningful names.
- ✂️ **Split PDFs** – Break up large PDFs into smaller files or extract specific pages.
- 📤 **Extract PDFs** – Extract custom page ranges or specific pages from PDFs.
- 🏷️ **Batch Processing** – Perform batch operations like merging all PDFs in a folder into one (with optional move), rename PDFs of entire folder at once, or split a PDF into multiple single-paged PDFs at once.
- 🖥️ **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** – Automate PDF operations like merge, rename, and split via terminal commands. Ideal for power users and scripting.
- 🗝️ **Encrypted PDFs Support** – When encountering an encrypted PDF, the app will prompt you for the password rather than failing silently.
- </> **CLI (v1.3.0)**: Refactored with subcommands and improved encrypted PDF support.
- 🎯 **User-friendly interface** – No learning curve, just click and go.
- ⚡ **Lightweight & fast** – Minimal dependencies and blazing performance.
- 💻 **Cross-platform** – Built with Python & Tkinter; runs on Windows and (with small tweaks) on macOS/Linux too.

## 🛠 Installation

To install and run PDF Toolkit locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JourneyCodesAyush/pdf-toolkit.git
   cd pdf-toolkit
   ```

2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

   # On Linux/macOS:
   source venv/bin/activate

   # On Windows CMD:
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat

   # On Windows PowerShell:
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) Make an executable (for Windows):

   First make sure **Pyinstaller** is installed

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

   Then run:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller main.spec
   ```

💡 Tip: The generated `.exe` can be found inside `dist/`.

> **CLI Usage**: The command-line interface is included for advanced users and automation. It requires cloning the repo and running via Python scripts (see Usage section).

<details><summary>Windows Quick Launch<b></b></summary>

This project includes a `launch_windows.bat` file to help run the app on Windows.

> Note: I'm not very experienced with Batch scripting, so while this script works on my setup, it's possible that issues might come up on other systems. If you're a Windows user and run into problems, feel free to open an issue or submit a fix!

```bash
.\launch_windows.bat
```

</details>

<details><summary>Linux Quick Launch<b></b></summary>

```bash
chmod +x launch_linux.sh
launch_linux.sh
```

</details>

## ▶️ Usage

Start the application using:

```bash
python main.py
```

You’ll see a friendly window with three options: **Merge**, **Rename**, or **Split** your PDFs. Just follow the prompts and you’re good to go!

## 🖥️ Using the CLI

For automation or advanced use cases, PDF Toolkit includes a CLI interface.
After cloning the repo and installing dependencies, you can run:

```bash
python main_cli.py --help
or
python -m cli --help
```

This will show available commands such as:

- `merge`
- `rename`
- `split`
- `batch_merge`
- `batch_rename`
- `batch_split`
- `--version` or `-v`
- `--skip-all`

Example:

_Recommended_

```bash
python -m cli merge --input file1.pdf file2.pdf --output merged.pdf
```

> Tip: You can still run `python main_cli.py ...` but using `python -m cli` is preferred for standard Python packaging.

> 🛡️ **Note:** Encrypted PDFs are now supported in the CLI. The app will prompt for a password if needed. You can still use `--skip-all` to bypass encrypted files.

> **_Note_**: CLI is intended for users comfortable with command-line tools and requires cloning the repository and installing dependencies. The GUI remains the recommended interface for typical users.

## 🛡️ Code Quality

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to automatically enforce code style and catch common issues before each commit.
It includes formatting tools like [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) and other useful checks.

Contributors are encouraged to install and run these hooks locally. Developers should refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and usage instructions.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, try the following steps:

- **Python version:**
  Make sure you are using Python 3.9 or above. Check your version with:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

- _Virtual environment_:
  If dependencies aren’t installing or the app crashes, try setting up and activating a virtual environment (see Installation section).

- _Missing dependencies_:
  Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

again to ensure all required packages are installed.

- **Permission errors**:
  On some systems, you might need to run commands with elevated permissions (e.g., sudo on Linux/Mac).

- **App doesn’t launch**:
  Check the terminal or command prompt for error messages and share them when reporting bugs.

- **Still stuck**?
  Open an issue on GitHub or contact the [author](https://github.com/journeycodesayush).

## 🧪 Testing

As of **_v0.7.0_**, _PDF Toolkit_ includes a growing suite of unit tests to ensure the reliability of its core and batch features.

### ✅ How to Run Tests

1. Make sure `pytest` is installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

2. Then from the project root, run:

```bash
pytest
```

> ⚠️**No module named core/**: Run this command

```bash
 python -m pytest
```

3. This will automatically discover and run all tests under the `tests/` directory.

## 🧬 Test Coverage

- Core modules: merge, split, rename
- Batch modules: batch-merge, batch-split, batch-rename
- Shared test fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`

Working towards expanding test coverage. Contributions welcome!

## 📜 Logging & Error Handling

The app is equipped with built-in logging for user actions and robust error handling. It logs user operations and captures unexpected issues to avoid crashes — helping both developers and users stay informed.
