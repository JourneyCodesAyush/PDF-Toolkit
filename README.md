1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JourneyCodesAyush/pdf-toolkit.git
   cd pdf-toolkit
   ```

2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

   # On Linux/macOS:
   source venv/bin/activate       

   # On Windows CMD:
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat

## ▶️ Usage

Start the application using:

```bash
python main.py
```

You’ll see a friendly window with three options: **Merge**, **Rename**, or **Split** your PDFs. Just follow the prompts and you’re good to go!

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, try the following steps:

- **Python version:**  
  Make sure you are using Python 3.9 or above. Check your version with:  
  ```bash
  python --version 
  ```

- *Virtual environment*:
If dependencies aren’t installing or the app crashes, try setting up and activating a virtual environment (see Installation section).

- *Missing dependencies*:
Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
again to ensure all required packages are installed.

- **Permission errors**:
On some systems, you might need to run commands with elevated permissions (e.g., sudo on Linux/Mac).

- **App doesn’t launch**:
Check the terminal or command prompt for error messages and share them when reporting bugs.

- **Still stuck**?
Open an issue on GitHub or contact the [author](https://github.com/journeycodesayush).

## 🧪 Testing
As of ***v0.7.0***, *PDF Toolkit* includes a growing suite of unit tests to ensure the reliability of its core and batch features.

### ✅ How to Run Tests
1. Make sure `pytest` is installed:
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```
2. Then from the project root, run:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
> ⚠️**No module named core/**: Run this command

  ```bash
   python -m pytest
   ```

3. This will automatically discover and run all tests under the `tests/` directory.

## 🧬 Test Coverage

- Core modules: merge, split, rename
- Batch modules: batch-merge, batch-split, batch-rename
- Shared test fixtures in  `tests/conftest.py`

Working towards expanding test coverage. Contributions welcome!

## 📜 Logging & Error Handling

The app is equipped with built-in logging for user actions and robust error handling. It logs user operations and captures unexpected issues to avoid crashes — helping both developers and users stay informed.
