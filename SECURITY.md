# Security Policy

## Overview

PDF Toolkit is a local desktop application built with Python and Tkinter. It runs entirely on your computer without internet access, minimizing exposure to remote attacks.

## Security Considerations

- **Local Use Only:** The app does not connect to the internet and operates solely on your local machine.
- **PDF File Handling:** Be cautious when processing PDFs from untrusted or unknown sources. Malformed or malicious PDFs may cause unexpected behavior or crashes.
- **Safe File Operations:** The application performs validations to prevent accidental overwriting or unsafe file handling.
- **Dependencies:** The project relies on well-maintained third-party libraries (e.g., PyPDF2). Keeping dependencies updated is recommended to reduce security risks.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities, please report them privately by emailing:

[journeycodes.ayush@gmail.com](mailto:journeycodes.ayush@gmail.com)

Please avoid public disclosure until a fix is released to protect all users.

Thank you for helping keep PDF Toolkit safe and secure!
